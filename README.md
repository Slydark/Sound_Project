# Sound_Project
read the wav file:
header wav. 
play the audio file in gui. 
write and save a wav file:
create the sin wave with duration and frequency. 
make a DFT signal and show it in the window. 
make an FFT signal showing in the window better and faster than DFT. 
create a vocoder autotune and implemented it in a voice and better with mic input. 
make a low pass filter for the audio. 

Update - the low pass filter not in this project
